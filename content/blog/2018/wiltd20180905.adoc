This past week, I attended Ansible Workshop by Redhat. This was attended with the Linux Admin Team, Storage and some Windows admin.
It was informative. It was fast. I believe it was somewhat pointed to Ansible Tower Product.

Also, made progress on SSIS hindered by space limitations on hard drive.

find netforum-related server to base and deploy Merkle etl.

Made some progress on freeing hard-drive space. Need to periodically monitor various directories and sub-directories.

Discovered KeyCloak also from Redhat. It is an SSO implementation. Matt Raible - now works for Octa. JHipster

What can be done to assist Membership? What can be done to attract new members, younger members; retain members?

Mobile apps - Stars tickets; ICLookup

Colaboration

Docker boot2docker as I am on Windows 7.

Learning Angular 4,5 Ionic, Cordova. docker, git, react

== Diagram Block Macro

There is another way to use the diagram
extension instead of via a block definition. We
can use a block macro to refer to an external
file that has the diagram definition.

The name of the diagram extension is the
block macro name. For example for a Ditaa diagram
we use `ditaa::` and for PlantUML
we use `plantuml::`. This is followed
by a filename of the file that contains the
diagram source.

We can define attributes just like with the
block definition. The first positional attribute
define the filename. Or we use the attribute
name `target` to set the output filename. The second
positional attribute is the file format. Instead
we can use the attribute `format`.

In the next example we use a block macro
to include a Ditaa diagram definition:

// The first positional attribute is the
// file target name (or we use attribute target),
// the second positional attribute is the
// file format (or use attribute format).
// Other attributes can also be defined.

== Angular 5 file upload

----
Here is an working example for file upload to api:

Step 1: HTML Template (file-upload.component.html)

Define simple input tag of type file. Add an function to (change)-event for handling choosing files.

<div class="form-group">
    <label for="file">Choose File</label>
    <input type="file"
           id="file"
           (change)="handleFileInput($event.target.files)">
</div>
Step 2: Upload Handling in TypeScript (file-upload.component.ts)

Define an default variable for selected file.

fileToUpload: File = null;
Create function which you use in (change)-event of your file input tag:

handleFileInput(files: FileList) {
    this.fileToUpload = files.item(0);
}
If you will to handle multifile selection, than you can iterate through this files array.

Now create file upload function by calling you file-upload.service:

uploadFileToActivity() {
    this.fileUploadService.postFile(this.fileToUpload).subscribe(data => {
      // do something, if upload success
      }, error => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  }
Step 3: File-Upload Service (file-upload.service.ts)

By uploading a file via POST-method you should use FormData, because so you can add file to http request.

postFile(fileToUpload: File): Observable<boolean> {
    const endpoint = 'your-destination-url';
    const formData: FormData = new FormData();
    formData.append('fileKey', fileToUpload, fileToUpload.name);
    return this.httpClient
      .post(endpoint, formData, { headers: yourHeadersConfig })
      .map(() => { return true; })
      .catch((e) => this.handleError(e));
}
So this is very simple working example, which I use every day in my work.
